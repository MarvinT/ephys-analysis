# ephys-analysis
scripts and utilities for processing electrophysiology data

# mini-hackathon

## goals
- pull together a repository of code for common ephys analyses
  - isolation quality
  - spike width
  - neuron location
  - rasters
  - PSTHs
  - behavior parsing
- ensure code is well documented
  - numpy docstrings (see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
- everyone can learn how to branch/commit/pull-request/rebase
- maybe @MarvinT can even teach us how to do unit tests?

## approach

If you have code written already that works toward these ends, do the following...

1. create a new branch of this repository
2. add your files to `ephys`
3. open a pull request for your branch

We'll hack on and merge branches as needed during the hackathon.
